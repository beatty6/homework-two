            “I cannot go to school today,”<br>Said little Peggy Ann McKay.<br>“I have the measles and the mumps,<br>A gash, a rash and purple bumps.<br>My mouth is wet, my throat is dry,<br>I’m going blind in my right eye.<br>My tonsils are as big as rocks,<br>I’ve counted sixteen chicken pox<br>And there’s one more--that’s seventeen,<br>And don’t you think my face looks green?<br>My leg is cut--my eyes are blue--<br>

        <p class="poem">
            It might be instamatic flu.<br>I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke,<br>I’m sure that my left leg is broke--<br>My hip hurts when I move my chin,<br>My belly button’s caving in,<br>My back is wrenched, my ankle’s sprained,<br>My ‘pendix pains each time it rains.<br>My nose is cold, my toes are numb.<br>I have a sliver in my thumb.<br>My neck is stiff, my voice is weak,<br>I hardly whisper when I speak.<br>My tongue is filling up my mouth,<br>I think my hair is falling out.<br>My elbow’s bent, my spine ain’t straight,<br>My temperature is one-o-eight.<br>

        <p class="poem">
            My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear,<br>There is a hole inside my ear.<br>I have a hangnail, and my heart is--what?<br>What’s that? What’s that you say?<br>You say today is. . .Saturday?<br>G’bye, I’m going out to play!”<br>
